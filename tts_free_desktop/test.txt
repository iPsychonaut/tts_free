For disabled users, AI agents open up entirely new possibilities. Instead of waiting for someone else to build the perfect tool, it’s now possible to describe the kind of assistant you need — in plain language — on a platform like MindStudio and have a rough prototype generated automatically. That means if you face a specific access barrier and think an agent could help, you don’t need a team of developers to start solving it. You can build something yourself, test the idea, and refine it before bringing in professionals like occupational therapists or software developers for further support.
That’s exactly the process I used to develop the tool I’m using right now to give this course. I wanted an app that would allow me to read sentence by sentence using a realistic AI voice, to present material more naturally and at my own pace. But there was nothing on the market that did exactly what I needed. So I created an initial version using Lovable.ai — a bit clunky at first, but good enough to show the concept. Then I shared it with a developer, who built the fully functioning version I now use to speak with you.
